# CoX Light Colors
This plugin allows you to choose custom colors for the light that appears above the loot chest in Chambers of Xeric.
Set custom colors for getting a unique drop, Metamorphic Dust, Twisted Kit, and of course, no special loot at all.
It also allows you to change the color of the barrier used to enter Olm's lair.
