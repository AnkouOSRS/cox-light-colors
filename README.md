# CoX Light Colors
This plugin allows you to choose custom colors for the light that appears above the loot chest in Chambers of Xeric.
Set custom colors for getting a unique drop, Metamorphic Dust, Twisted Kit, and of course, no special loot at all.
It also allows you to change the color of the barrier used to enter Olm's lair.  

If you find any bugs or would like to request a feature, please do so at the [issues page](https://github.com/AnkouOSRS/cox-light-colors/issues).
